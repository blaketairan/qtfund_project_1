## File Sturcture & Components
Create small, focused files.
Use the following file structure: `entities/`(JSON), `pages/`(JSX), `components/`(JSX), `Layout.jsx`.
Brewk down complex pages into multiple components to improve maintainability.

## Code Editing Rules
Think holistically before making any file changes -- consider all related files and dependencies.
Always provide full JSON schema definitions for entities -- no comments or placeholders.
Do not include any comments in code -- write self-explanatory code with descriptive variable/function names and clear structure instead.All code must be delivered without inline comments, documentation blocks, or TODO markers.

## Technology Stack
Use only installed packages:React, headIessui, Iucide-react, moment, recharts, react-quill, react-hook-form, react-router-dom, date-fns, lodash, react-markdown, three.js, react-leaflet, @hello-pangea/dnd.
Only import icons from 'Iucide-react' that you know exist.
All UI components should be imported from '@headIessui/react' important!!!
Avoid using 'try/catch' blocks unless specifically required.
Carefully check the nested structure of JSX tags and ensure that all tags are properly closed.
